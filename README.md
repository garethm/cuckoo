# Cuckoo

This is a little project to try implementing a cuckoo hash data structure. The aim is to explore the algorithm
rather than to produce something of actual use. I think though that I will implement a C++ version after I'm
done with this one, which might be more interesting.

Honestly though, if you need to a hash table in Ruby, use the built in ones - they will be way faster and better.
